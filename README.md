# Just-another-mining-program-for-CC
Just another mining program that uses monitors and turtles in CC:Tweaked

### What?
There are 2 files, one for the turtles you'll be using and one for the computer that will send commands and control monitors.

### Ok, so?
The point is to use turtles one on top of eachother to maximize the <ins>minign</ins> process.

### Check your spelling man.
The point of the project is to be a template for other monitor-turtle-modem applications in CC:Tweaked.

## Examples:
![Example with one turtle.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113848275/190916394-907104e0-a977-4464-b449-40a8c18fbe32.png)

## How to install
Download the files to your PC, and drag and drop `turtlemine.lua` into your ***turtles*** and `monitormine.lua` into the CC:Tweaked ***computer*** that is connected to a monitor.

Alternatively, you could also perform the `pastebin get VCcEPSP6` to download the program to turtles, and the `pastebin get Gjf1ASgh` for computers, without the need to download files from github.

Both systems will require a wireless or advanced wireless modems.

When the program is started up, the computer will tell the instructions to the turtles.

## NOTES
Some features I would like to add would be the ability to mine up or down, and colour codes in advanced monitors.
