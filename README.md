# Just-another-mining-program-for-CC
Just another mining program that uses monitors and turtles in CC:Tweaked

### What?
There are 2 files, one for the turtles you'll be using and one for the computer that will send commands and control monitors.

### Ok, so?
The point is to use turtles one on top of eachother to maximize the <ins>minign</ins> process.

### Check your spelling man.
The point of the project is to be a template for other monitor-turtle-modem applications in CC:Tweaked.

## Examples:
![Example with one turtle.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113848275/190916394-907104e0-a977-4464-b449-40a8c18fbe32.png)

## How to install
Download the files to your PC, and drag and drop `turtlemine.lua` into your ***turtles*** and `monitormine.lua` into the CC:Tweaked ***computer*** that is connected to a monitor.

Both systems will require a wireless or advanced wireless modems.
